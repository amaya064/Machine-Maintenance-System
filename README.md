## How to flow this web app


First, activate both the **frontend** and the **backend**. When it is done correctly, the link to the website on the frontend will be displayed. By doing so, you can access the website.

**As a customer,**

when using this site for the first time, he must first register. For that, he can get an understanding by clicking the **Get Started** button.
Accordingly, the **Sign Up** button in the navigation bar must be clicked first. Then, in the form that appears, fill in all the details such as Email, Password, Phone Number, Address, etc. and you can register in the system. If you are using our system for the first time, **you must definitely register.**
Then, click **Already have an account? Sign in** to get the required form for signing in to the system. There, you can access the system by entering the email address and password you provided during registration and clicking the **Sign In** button. If it is done correctly, you will be auto-navigated to the home page. Also, a **new tab** will open in the menu bar as **Book** so that you can purchase books. This can only be used when you are logged in to the system. You will be able to purchase a book through the system accordingly. After purchasing, you can access your profile by clicking on the **email address** that appears on the right side of this menu bar. When you click on the **My Payments** button there, you can see the details of your order. You can also use the **LOGOUT** button to log out of the system.


**As a Administrator,**

Imagine that you are the person in charge of the system. When you log in to the system, you should use the **Admin** button in the navigation bar.
Then, on the page that opens, when you click on Selection Login Type, a list will be displayed under it. If you have selected **Admin**, the relevant
form will be displayed. There, **I have provided the password of the institution owner for the Admin login**. 
Use the information given below for that:

   ```bash
   Admin

**Only the admin can add an employee to the system.** For this, the button called **Register Employee** can be used on the **adminhome** page
. The details of the employees so added can be viewed using the **view Employee** button. There, their information can be **updated** and they can also be **removed** from the system.
